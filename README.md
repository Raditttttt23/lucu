# The Glitcher

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/airnan/pen/gWLvjM](https://codepen.io/airnan/pen/gWLvjM).

Gumball and Darwin dancing SVG animation.  
We are unconditional fans of The amazing world of gumball.  
In the spirit of the series and how they are always playing with animation techniques, we made this interactive glitcher.  
Every time you click you get a new effect.  
All glitches are made by vertex modifiers that take mouse coordinates and animation vertices as input and outputs a new set of transformed coordinates.  
No svg filters at all.
